# ► Placeholders (unknown replacement can be configured under placeholder.unknown-value):
# 1. Player:
#    - {uuid}: player's UUID
#    - {name}: player's name, or unknown if not available
#    - {id}: player's name, or UUID if not available
# 2. Info:
#    - {cps_best}: the best CPS
#    - {cps_best_date}: formatted date at which the best CPS were achieved (or unknown if the best CPS are 0)
#    - {cps_best_date_millis}: date in millis at which the best CPS were achieved (or unknown if the best CPS are 0)
#    - {cps_best_date_formatted}: alias for {cps_best_date}
#    - placeholders from the player group
# 3. All:
#    - {cps_now}: current CPS
#    - placeholders from the player and info groups

    # Limit (amount of places) of the fetched leaderboard:
    # - INFO >> If you're using FILE storage, this is ignored. The cached leaderboard is used for all placeholders
    #           and also the command (unless the flag is used). With that being said, set this appropriately to how many
    #           top places you want to allow players to see, or how many of them you want to display, for example, on a

    batch:
      # Fetch all queued profiles when there's at least (= exactly) this amount of them:
      # - IMPORTANT >> For relatively low traffic servers, you can set this to 1 (fetch everytime someone joins the
      #                server and their profile is not cached). Otherwise, this should be approximately equal to the
      #                amount of players joining the server per the rate configured below (if the rate is 5 ticks=0.25s.
      #                and during those 0.25s on average 10 players join the server, this should be set to 10).
      size: 10
      # Fetch all queued profiles (at maximum) after this delay in ticks since the last request:
      # - INFO >> The delay can be shorter if the size trigger invokes fetching earlier. This is just a safety check if
      #           your server does not have big enough network for the trigger above. Set to 0 to disable and only rely
      #           on the size trigger (potentially dangerous in terms of fetch times).

#
# Sampling rate in ticks:
# - INFO >> The lower sampling rate, the higher the demands for server processing power. Rate of 0 indicates immediate
#           sampling, which will compute CPS non-stop according to your clicks (the best user experience). Rates 1 and
#           higher represent rated sampling, which simply divides time into periods (each equally long according to the
#           rate) and then computes CPS from the amount of times you've clicked during that period.
# - IMPORTANT >> Use of values between 0 and 20 will lead to imprecise calculations, you should avoid those rates. Use
#                only 0, 20 or higher. Make sure to update the display refresh rates, so they do not bottleneck the
#                sampling capabilities.
